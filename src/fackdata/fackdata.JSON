External links are the most crucial source of ranking power, according to SEO professionals, because search engines see them as third-party votes for your website.  Do outbound links from your own website, on the other hand, have an impact on SEO? According to a recent study by marketing agency Reboot, there is a link between a page's outbound links and its search results rankings. Google can identify the authority of a page or website based on the sources it connects to, according to Reboot."
